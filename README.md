### Introduction

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plays a pivotal role in the global economy, fostering international collaborations and driving economic growth. 

This case study delves into an analysis of FDI data, employing Tableau for visual insights. 

The objective is to guide business decisions by identifying sectors that prove most beneficial for collaboration.

### Understanding FDI

FDI involves a corporation from one country making an investment into a corporation of another country. 

Unlike indirect investments, FDI requires control over various aspects, such as technology and management. 

Large firms typically engage in FDI, seeking to establish a significant presence in foreign jurisdictions.

### Key Analytical Objectives

a)Which sector receives the maximum direct funding for a given year?

b)Which sector receives the minimum direct funding for a given year?

c)Is there any trend of overall foreign direct investment

d) In what fashion can the sectors be grouped for comparision?

e) Which sectors reported high growth in FDI in last 5 years?

f) Which sectors reported lowest growth in FDI in last 5 years?

g)Which sectors reported the most variation overall?

h)What is the proportion of each sector in FDI?

i)Are there some specific clusters that are present here?

j)What is the forecast for next year?

### Maximum and Minimum FDI:

The analysis begins by identifying the sectors that attract the maximum and minimum direct funding for each year. This insight helps pinpoint lucrative sectors for potential collaboration.

In this categorization, sectors are differentiated into two groups:

 those marked in red have not witnessed substantial Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) over the 17-year period, falling below the established baseline of 1000. 

Sectors depicted in blue have attracted FDI amounts surpassing our predefined baseline. 

This classification aids in identifying sectors that may require additional attention or strategic considerations for further exploration and investment.

Exploring sectors with the most variation in FDI provides insights into dynamic industries.

 Understanding the factors contributing to this variation is essential for risk management.
