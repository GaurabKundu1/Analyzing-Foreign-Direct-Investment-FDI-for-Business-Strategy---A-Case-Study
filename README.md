## Author: [Gaurab Kundu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurab-kundu/)

### Introduction

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a driving force in the global economy, fostering international collaborations and economic growth. This case study employs Tableau for a comprehensive analysis of FDI data, aiming to guide business decisions by identifying sectors with the highest potential for collaboration.

### Understanding FDI

FDI involves one country's corporation making investments in another country's corporation. Unlike indirect investments, FDI requires control over various aspects, such as technology and management. Large firms typically engage in FDI to establish a significant presence in foreign jurisdictions.

### Key Analytical Objectives

a) **Maximum and Minimum FDI:**
   Identifying sectors attracting the maximum and minimum direct funding helps pinpoint lucrative sectors for potential collaboration.

b) **Sector Grouping & Variation:**
   Organizing sectors based on shared characteristics facilitates meaningful comparisons. Sectors are categorized into red (below the baseline of 1000 FDI) and blue (above the baseline), aiding in strategic considerations.

   Exploring sectors with the most variation in FDI provides insights into dynamic industries essential for risk management.

d) **Sectors Reported High and Lowest Growth in FDI (Last 5 Years):**
   Identifying sectors with high and low growth in the last 5 years informs strategic choices.

e) **Proportion of Each Sector in FDI:**
   Determining the proportion of each sector in FDI offers a macro-level view for resource allocation and risk assessment.
